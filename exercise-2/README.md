  Create a **NotificationService class** with a method that displays a message.

  Create another class. In this case we need a **UserService class** that contains a NotifiticationService attribute.

  Use the spring annotation. Implemente the **@Component** in each class
   
  ```bash
  @Component
  public class NameClass {

  }
  ```

  Enable class scanning in the **beans.xml** file.

  From the main method, try to get the UserService bean and execute the method that has the attribute of type NotificationService associated with it.
